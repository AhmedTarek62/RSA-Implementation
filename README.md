# RSA-Implementation
Implementation of the RSA Algorithm using C. The project can be divided into modules: 
1- Prime Number Generator 
2- Modular Inverse Generator
3- Implemetation of the Euclidean Greatest Common Divisor Algorithm 
4- Encryption Module
5- Decryption Module 
It takes the input as a text file and generates two outputs an encrypted text file and a decrypted text file.
